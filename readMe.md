simpleColor
------

<br>this is a simple color callup for lua/löve2d.
containing 9 different colors.
its to use rather than typing more than you need to for colors such as RGB or white/black.
instead you just type the name of the colors.

there are a few colors [so far], these are the names you use as well. by all means, fork this and add your own. would be nice to keep adding

• black<br>
• white<br>
• gray<br>
• red<br>
• green<br>
• blue<br>
etc...

if you open up the simpleColors.lua file, you will notice they are just tables, but think its good practice as well.

when in lua/löve2d. use `require 'simpleColor'`, with simpleColor.lua in the project file.

example<br>
`love.graphics.setColor(white)`

have fun...
