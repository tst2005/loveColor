simpleColor
------

<br>this is a simple color callup for lua/löve2d.
containing 9 different colors.
its to use rather than typing more than you need to for colors such as RGB or white/black.
instead you just type the name of the colors.

9 colors [so far], these are the names you use as well.

• black<br>
• white<br>
• gray<br>
• red<br>
• green<br>
• blue<br>
• yellow<br>
• purple<br>
• cyan<br>

if you open up the simpleColors.lua file, you will notice they are just tables, but think its good practice as well.

have fun...
