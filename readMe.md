löveColor
------
[originally called simpleColor]<br>
<br>this is a simple color callup for lua/löve2d. its to use rather than typing more than you need with RGB data.
instead you just type the name of the color.

there are a few colors [so far], these are the names you use as well. by all means, fork this and add your own. would be nice to keep adding

• black<br>
• white<br>
• gray<br>
• red<br>
• green<br>
• blue<br>
etc...

when in lua/löve2d. use `require 'loveColor'`, with löveColor.lua in the project folder.
an example is also in the folder [`main.lua`], just so you can get up and running.
just copy `loveColor.lua` to where you will use it, just to be safe ;)

have phün...
